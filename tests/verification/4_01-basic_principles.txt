what are the basic principles of the model?
will the model provide insights on these principles?
does the model use new/ pre-developed theory for agent traits from which the system dynamics emerge?




The model is based off existing studies on how the bacteria population can gain a resistance
to antibiotics. This model is meant to provide insight on how bacteria gain a resistance and
how they respond to different applications of antibiotics
