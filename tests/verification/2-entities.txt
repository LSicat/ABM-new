What are the entities, what their state variables (attributes) ?

What are the scales used (ie temporal resolution, spatial resolution and bounds)?

The entities in this model are

1. The bacteria

The bacteria are agents with 4 state variables. It has a lifespan attribute to represent how many ticks will the bacteria live. When this reaches 0, the bacteria will die to represent the ageing process. Each bacteria has a resistance attribute for each antibiotic. This represents the chance that a bacteria will survive the antibiotics

2. The antibiotics

The antibiotics are represented by patches. Each patch can have a kind of antibiotic and the amount of antibiotics in it which will affect it's effectiveness in killing off bacteria
